Pump Control

pip install --no-index --find-links=package_folder -r requirements.txt

Multiple syringe pumps can automate device operation.

Procedure:

1. Image blank
2. Withdraw buffer from inlet
3. Infuse cells
4. FF withdraw flow pump
5. Turn on voltage
6. Wait 5 min withdraw flow pump
7. Withdraw cells from inlet
8. Infuse buffer
9. Wait ~2 min for channel to rinse
10. Image tips
11. Turn off voltage
12. Image transfer
12. FF withdraw flow pump

Repeat

Setup:

4 pumps controlled by serial input via usb
    0. Withdraw pump in outlet (Hamilton)
    1. Infuse pump in inlet for cells (Plastic)
    2. Infuse pump in inlet for buffer (Plastic)
    3. Withdraw pump in inlet for waste (Plastic)

Notes:
Each step of the procedure depends on careful timing, or triggering. Timing would likely fail, so sending and receiving
responses to pumps may activate further steps in the procedure.

There may be functions for the inlet pumps that withdraw or infuse specific volumes.

Not sure how exactly to drive Nikon Elements. Maybe write macros in elements, then use hotkeys to start macros. Python
could press the hotkeys?
    Edit: I DO NOT LIKE the Nikon macro language. I do not know C. Keeping it simple might be best. Autocapture a
    sequence of images, then rename the images post experiment.

The hotkeys + inputs could be used to drive MFG as well. XML files is also an option for the MFG. I don't like the
python input approach.
